<!--- Hi htsdsdsml is very cool to learn-->
<p>
What is the difference between Git slash apply and 
Git slash pop?
<p>
Ans. The 'Git slash apply 'and 'Git slash pop' commands
and are used when you have to reapply the slashed changes and start working from where you left.
<p>
The difference between them is that while the 'Git slash apply'
command keeps the changes in the slash list for later use ,
the 'Git slash pop'command removes the changes from the slash
after applying it.
